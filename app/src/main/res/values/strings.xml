    <string name="disclaimer">This mobile application
        (ADDNapp) is userd for 
        benchmarking data(HBA1c and 
        BMI) with the Australasian type-1 
        diabetes platform(ADDN). The 
        ADDNapp is completely secure 
        and it does not try to collect 
        other data, e.g. it does not access other services on your 
        phone such as your current 
        location. Should you have any 
         concerns regarding the app then 
         in the first instrance we 
         recommend the you contact the 
         Meibourne eResearch Group 
         (wwww.eresearch.unimelb.edu.au). 
         This app was supported through 
         a grant from the National 
         eResearch Collaboration Tools 
         and Resources (NeCTAR-www.nectar.org.au) project. 
         ADDN is supported byu a grant 
         from the Juvenile Diabetes 
         Research Foundation(JDRF-

    <string name="hba1c_desc">HbA1c is a term commonly userd  in relation to diabetes.HbA1c refers to glycated haemoglobin. 
         It develops when haemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your 
         body, joins with glucose in the blood, becoming glycated. By 
         measuring HbA1c, clinicians are able to get an overall picture of 
         what the average blood sugar levels have been over a period of 
         weeks/months. For people with diabetes this is important as the 
         higher the HbA1c, the greater the rish of developing diabetes-related complications.</string>
